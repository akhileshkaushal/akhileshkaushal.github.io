Case Study: Chromatin Accessibility in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA)
=====================================================================

This case study demonstrates how the ATAC-seq pipeline was applied to uncover regulatory disruptions in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a rare congenital bone marrow failure syndrome.

Overview
--------

**Study Design**:

- **Samples**: 6 DBA patients and 6 healthy controls
- **Cell type**: CD34+ enriched HSPCs isolated from peripheral blood
- **Platform**: Illumina NovaSeq 6000, 50M paired-end reads/sample
- **Reference Genome**: hg38
- **Additional Omics**: Matched H3K27ac ChIP-seq and DNA methylation (EPIC array)

Pipeline Summary
-----------------

The raw FASTQ files were processed using the full ATAC-seq pipeline:

- Adapter trimming: `fastp`
- Alignment: `bowtie2` with chrM filtering
- Tn5 shift correction: `alignmentSieve`
- Deduplication: `Picard`
- Peak calling: `MACS2` with `--nomodel --shift -100 --extsize 200`
- Differential analysis: `DESeq2` on consensus peaks
- Signal tracks: `bamCoverage` with RPGC normalization
- Annotation: `ChIPseeker`, `annotatr`, and `LOLA`

Results and Interpretation
---------------------------

1. Global Chromatin Accessibility Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- PCA and hierarchical clustering revealed strong separation between DBA and control samples.
- Over 2,100 differentially accessible regions (DARs) were identified (FDR < 0.05).
- Volcano plot showed enrichment of up-accessible peaks in promoters and down-accessible peaks in enhancers.

2. Peak Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- 42% of DARs mapped to promoters (±2 kb from TSS)
- 31% overlapped distal enhancers (as defined by H3K27ac marks)
- Genes with promoter DARs included: *GATA1*, *RPS19*, *FUBP1*, *SPI1*

3. Integration with Histone Modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- DARs were intersected with public and matched H3K27ac ChIP-seq data (ENCODE and study-derived).
- ~60% of down-accessible enhancers in DBA overlapped with H3K27ac-depleted regions.
- Up-accessible sites in DBA were often devoid of H3K27me3, suggesting loss of Polycomb repression.

4. Transcription Factor Binding Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- HOMER motif enrichment on DARs revealed:
  - **Enriched in DBA up-DARs**: SPI1 (PU.1), GFI1, IRF8
  - **Enriched in DBA down-DARs**: GATA1, KLF1, TAL1
- TOBIAS footprinting confirmed decreased occupancy of GATA1 at promoter-proximal sites.

5. Methylation Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- DARs were intersected with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from EPIC array analysis:
  - 340 DARs overlapped with hypomethylated regions (mostly in up-accessible promoters)
  - 412 DARs overlapped with hypermethylated regions (primarily down-accessible enhancers)
- These results suggest epigenetic silencing of regulatory elements in DBA.

6. Regulatory Modules and Pathways
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Enrichment analysis (GO/KEGG):
  - Up-accessible: inflammatory response, myeloid differentiation
  - Down-accessible: erythrocyte development, ribosome biogenesis
- LOLA and GREAT identified enrichment of DARs in hematopoietic enhancer clusters and MYB/SPI1-regulated loci.

7. Multi-Omics Visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- UCSC Genome Browser snapshots showed coordinated changes:
  - *GATA1* promoter: decreased ATAC signal, loss of H3K27ac, increased methylation
  - *IRF8* enhancer: increased ATAC signal, gain of H3K27ac, demethylated CpG island

Conclusion
----------

The integrative ATAC-seq analysis revealed widespread remodeling of cis-regulatory elements in DBA. Specifically, the data highlighted repression of erythroid transcriptional programs through enhancer and promoter silencing, and compensatory activation of immune-related regulators. These results support a model where DBA pathogenesis involves epigenetic interference in lineage-specific transcription factor networks.

This case illustrates the value of multi-layered ATAC-seq analysis—including motif, histone mark, and methylation overlays—for deciphering complex hematopoietic disorders.

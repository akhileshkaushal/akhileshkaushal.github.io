ATAC-seq Pipeline
=================

**Author**: Akhilesh Kaushal

The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (**ATAC-seq**) is a powerful technique designed to map genome-wide chromatin accessibility at high resolution using minimal input material. By leveraging the hyperactive Tn5 transposase to insert sequencing adapters into open regions of chromatin, ATAC-seq allows researchers to rapidly and efficiently profile regulatory DNA in a variety of biological contexts.

This pipeline provides a comprehensive, modular framework for processing and analyzing ATAC-seq data—from raw FASTQ files through to differential peak analysis and integrative visualizations. Built with scalability, reproducibility, and clarity in mind, it supports a wide range of experimental designs and computational environments.

Overview
--------

The ATAC-seq pipeline includes the following key steps:

- Quality control and preprocessing of sequencing reads

- Alignment to reference genomes (e.g., hg38, mm10, rn6)

- Deduplication and filtering of reads

- Peak calling to identify accessible chromatin regions

- Differential accessibility analysis across conditions

- Peak annotation and visualization

- Optional footprinting and transcription factor binding inference

Detailed Workflow Overview
--------------------------

1. **Input Preparation**: Accepts raw FASTQ files (single-end or paired-end) and sample metadata.

2. **Quality Control (QC)**:

- Adapter trimming using fastp or Trim Galore

- Pre-alignment QC reports with FastQC and summary with MultiQC

3. **Read Alignment**:

- High-speed alignment with BWA-MEM or Bowtie2

- Optional mitochondrial DNA filtering

4. **Post-alignment Processing**:

- Sorting and indexing with Samtools

- Deduplication using Picard MarkDuplicates or Samtools rmdup

- Tn5 shift correction for proper read centering on insertion site

5. **Peak Calling**:

- Using MACS2 with parameters optimized for narrow peaks

- Generates narrowPeak files and summit positions

6. **Signal Track Generation**:

- BigWig files via deepTools for genome browser visualization

- Normalization using CPM, RPGC, or RPKM

7. **Quality Metrics Aggregation**:

- FRiP scores, insert size distribution, duplication rate, alignment rate, etc.

8. **Differential Accessibility Analysis**:

- Peak matrix construction with featureCounts or bedtools multicov

- Statistical testing using DESeq2, edgeR, or limma

9. **Peak Annotation**:

- Assign peaks to nearest genes using ChIPseeker, HOMER, or annotatePeaks.pl

10. **Optional Footprinting & Motif Analysis**:

- HINT-ATAC or TOBIAS for footprinting

- Motif enrichment using HOMER, MEME, or PWMScan

11. **Integrative Visualization**:

- Genome browser tracks, heatmaps, metaplots using deepTools

- Volcano plots and PCA plots for accessibility differences

Biological Applications
-----------------------

ATAC-seq has a broad range of biological applications, including:

- Mapping genome-wide chromatin accessibility

- Identifying enhancers, promoters, and other cis-regulatory elements

- Inferring transcription factor occupancy through footprinting

- Studying dynamic chromatin remodeling across cell types or conditions

- Integrating with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for regulatory network inference

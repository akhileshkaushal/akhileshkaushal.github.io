ChIP-seq Pre-processing and Analysis Pipeline
=============================================

**Author**: Akhilesh Kaushal

Overview
--------

This pipeline offers an end-to-end solution for the analysis of Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, supporting both transcription factor (TF) and histone modification profiling. It is built for reproducibility, scalability, and flexibility across a variety of experimental designs and platforms. The pipeline adheres to best practices established by the ENCODE Consortium and is optimized for both single-end and paired-end sequencing data.

It automates essential processing steps, from raw read quality control through to peak calling and differential enrichment analysis, ensuring consistent and robust results suitable for publication and downstream interpretation.

Scope and Applications
----------------------

The pipeline supports a wide range of applications in epigenomics and transcriptional regulation research, including:

- **Transcription factor binding site profiling**  
  Identify and quantify TF occupancy across the genome.

- **Histone mark landscape analysis**  
  Map histone modifications such as H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, and H3K27me3 to infer chromatin states.

- **Differential binding analysis**  
  Detect changes in chromatin occupancy between experimental conditions, time points, or treatments.

- **Chromatin state annotation and genome segmentation**  
  Integrate peak data with chromatin annotation tools for regulatory landscape modeling.

- **Integration with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq**  
  Designed to interface with transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility datasets for multi-omic analysis.

Pipeline Highlights
-------------------

- **Standards-compliant**: Built using guidelines from ENCODE, modENCODE, and other community standards.
- **Portable and scalable**: Can run on local machines, HPC environments, or in the cloud using containerized environments (Apptainer/Docker).
- **Modular**: Easily customizable at each stage depending on experimental needs.
- **Extensible**: Designed to integrate with downstream functional enrichment tools such as GREAT, ChIPseeker, and clusterProfiler.

Pipeline Modules
----------------

The pipeline is organized into modular components that can be independently configured and executed:

1. **Quality Control & Adapter Trimming**  
   - Tools: `FastQC`, `Trim Galore`, `cutadapt`  
   - Remove adapters and low-quality bases, and assess sequencing quality.

2. **Genome Alignment & Filtering**  
   - Tools: `BWA`, `Bowtie2`, `SAMtools`  
   - Align reads to the reference genome, remove duplicates, and retain uniquely mapping reads.

3. **Peak Detection & Annotation**  
   - Tools: `MACS2`, `SEACR`, `HOMER`, `ChIPseeker`  
   - Identify enriched regions (peaks) and annotate them with gene features or custom annotations.

4. **Signal Track Generation**  
   - Tools: `deepTools`, `bedGraphToBigWig`  
   - Generate normalized signal profiles (bigWig) for visualization in genome browsers like UCSC or IGV.

5. **Differential Enrichment Analysis**  
   - Tools: `DiffBind`, `csaw`, `DESeq2`  
   - Compare ChIP enrichment across experimental groups, accounting for replicates and batch effects.

6. **(Optional) Blacklist Filtering and Quality Metrics**  
   - Remove ENCODE blacklisted regions and assess signal-to-noise ratios.

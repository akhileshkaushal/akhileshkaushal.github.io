Cut&Tag Preprocessing and Analysis Pipeline
===========================================

**Author:** Akhilesh Kaushal  

Overview
--------

This pipeline provides a complete, reproducible, and scalable workflow for the preprocessing and analysis of Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (Cut&Tag) data. Cut&Tag is a targeted epigenomic profiling technique that leverages antibody-targeted tagmentation to map DNA-protein interactions at high resolution. It offers significant improvements over traditional ChIP-seq in terms of sensitivity, cost-efficiency, and input requirements.

Cut&Tag enables **in situ tagmentation** using a fusion protein consisting of Protein A/G tethered to Tn5 transposase. This approach facilitates direct adapter integration at antibody-bound genomic regions, minimizing background signal and reducing the need for chromatin fragmentation or crosslinking.

Key Applications
----------------

- **Histone modification profiling**
  - Examples: H3K27ac, H3K4me3 (active), H3K27me3, H3K9me3 (repressive)
- **Transcription factor (TF) binding site mapping**
  - Applicable even in samples with very low cell numbers
- **Epigenomic profiling of rare or primary cell populations**
  - Suitable for primary tissues, sorted cell types, and clinical specimens
- **Single-cell chromatin accessibility and TF binding**
  - Adapted protocols such as scCut&Tag and multi-modal single-cell designs

Benefits Over ChIP-seq
----------------------

Cut&Tag offers a number of advantages that make it ideal for chromatin profiling, especially when working with precious or low-input samples:

- **Lower input requirements**: Requires as few as 1,000â€“10,000 cells per experiment
- **Higher signal-to-noise ratio**: In situ tagmentation yields reduced background
- **Eliminates need for sonication**: No mechanical fragmentation of chromatin required
- **Faster library preparation**: Library construction is integrated with binding/tagmentation
- **Cost-effective and scalable**: Ideal for both small-scale and high-throughput experiments
- **Minimal formaldehyde crosslinking**: Preserves native chromatin structure

Supported Experimental Designs
------------------------------

This pipeline is compatible with a variety of experimental setups, including:

- **Read Types**:
  - Single-end or paired-end sequencing
- **Replicates**:
  - Technical and biological replicates supported with differential analysis capability
- **Controls**:
  - Mock antibody controls or IgG
  - Spike-in controls (e.g., Drosophila DNA) for normalization
- **Peak Calling**:
  - Supports both **narrow peak** calling (e.g., for TFs like CTCF, GATA1)
  - And **broad peak** calling (e.g., for histone marks like H3K27me3)

Typical Workflow Steps
----------------------

1. **Raw read preprocessing** (adapter trimming, quality filtering)
2. **Alignment to reference genome**
3. **Deduplication and filtering**
4. **Fragment length estimation and QC**
5. **Peak calling (MACS2, SEACR, or custom models)**
6. **Differential analysis (e.g., DiffBind, csaw)**
7. **Visualization (bigWig, heatmaps, genome browser tracks)**
8. **Reporting and downstream enrichment (e.g., GO, pathway, motif)**

Preprocessing and Quality Control
=================================

This section outlines the essential steps for importing raw methylation data from IDAT files, performing quality control, filtering probes, and preparing normalized beta and M-values for downstream analysis. Proper QC and preprocessing ensure reliability and reproducibility of methylation results.

1. IDAT Import and Sample Sheet Configuration
---------------------------------------------

Raw methylation data are imported using the ``minfi::read.metharray.exp()`` function, which reads red and green fluorescence intensities from IDAT files. A well-structured sample sheet (CSV/TSV format) is required to associate array data with sample metadata.

The sample sheet must contain the following columns:

- ``Sample_Name``
- ``Sample_Group`` (e.g., Control, Disease)
- ``Slide``
- ``Array``
- ``Sex`` (optional)
- Additional covariates (e.g., Batch, CellType) as needed

.. code-block:: r

    rgSet <- read.metharray.exp(targets = "sampleSheet.csv")

2. Quality Control
------------------

Initial QC ensures sample integrity and data quality. Two main functions can be used:

- ``minfi::qcReport()`` – generates PDF with detection p-values, control probes, and signal distributions.
- ``ChAMP::champ.QC()`` – includes PCA and clustering plots for sample-level exploration.

Sample filtering is typically based on detection p-values, which assess the confidence of probe detection above background noise. Samples failing >1% of probes (p > 0.01) are removed.

.. code-block:: r

    detP <- detectionP(rgSet)
    failed <- colMeans(detP > 0.01) > 0.01
    rgSet <- rgSet[, !failed]

3. Probe Filtering
------------------

Unreliable probes are filtered to prevent technical artifacts from confounding biological interpretation. Filtering includes:

- Removing non-CpG probes (e.g., CHH, CHG context)
- Removing probes with SNPs at the CpG or single-base extension sites
- Removing cross-reactive probes (identified by sequence alignment)
- Optionally removing sex chromosome probes (for mixed-sex studies)

Useful resources and functions:

- ``ChAMP::champ.filter()``
- ``minfiData::dropLociWithSnps()``
- Blacklist from Zhou et al., 2016 (cross-reactive probes)

4. Normalization
----------------

Normalization adjusts for technical variability between arrays and probe types. Choice of method depends on sample heterogeneity:

- ``preprocessQuantile()`` – best for homogeneous samples (e.g., cell lines, blood)
- ``preprocessFunnorm()`` – better suited for heterogeneous tissues or multi-batch data
- ``ChAMP::champ.norm(method="BMIQ")`` – addresses type I/type II probe bias

.. code-block:: r

    mSet <- preprocessQuantile(rgSet)  # or preprocessFunnorm(rgSet)

5. Beta and M-value Extraction
------------------------------

Two common measures are used to quantify methylation:

- **Beta values**: Represent methylation proportion (range 0–1). Used for visualization.
- **M-values**: Logit-transformed beta values (log2(beta / (1 - beta))). Used for statistical analysis due to better variance homogeneity.

.. code-block:: r

    betaVals <- getBeta(mSet)
    mVals <- getM(mSet)

These matrices are used in downstream steps such as differential methylation testing, clustering, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).

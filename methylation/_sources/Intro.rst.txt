DNA Methylation Profiling Using Illumina EPIC Arrays
----------------------------------------------------

DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression, maintaining cellular identity, and modulating responses to environmental stimuli. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are frequently associated with disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and developmental syndromes.

The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC array) provides a robust, high-throughput platform to interrogate over 850,000 CpG sites across the human genome. These CpGs span gene promoters, gene bodies, enhancers, CpG islands, shores, and intergenic regulatory regions, making the EPIC array a versatile tool for epigenomic studies.

Why Use EPIC Arrays?
--------------------

- **Comprehensive genome-wide coverage** with an emphasis on functionally relevant CpG sites, including those implicated in gene regulation and enhancer activity.
- **Reproducibility and cost-efficiency**, making it ideal for large-scale studies such as clinical cohorts, case-control investigations, and longitudinal designs.
- **Compatibility with a wide range of sample types**, including formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and low-input DNA, expanding its applicability to archival samples.

Biological Applications
-----------------------

- Differential methylation analysis between disease and healthy samples to uncover epigenetic alterations.
- Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to detect CpG-level associations with phenotypic or environmental traits.
- Integration with transcriptomic (e.g., RNA-seq) or chromatin state (e.g., ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq) datasets to elucidate regulatory mechanisms.
- Discovery of methylation-based biomarkers and implementation of reference-based or reference-free cell-type deconvolution approaches.

Overview of the Analysis Workflow
---------------------------------

This pipeline facilitates preprocessing and differential methylation analysis of Illumina EPIC array data using a structured and modular framework. The core workflow includes:

1. **Raw data input**: IDAT files containing red and green fluorescence intensities.
2. **Quality control**: Sample- and probe-level metrics including detection p-values, control probe performance, and bisulfite conversion efficiency.
3. **Normalization**: Beta-mixture quantile normalization (BMIQ), noob background correction, or functional normalization to adjust for technical variability.
4. **Filtering**: Removal of low-quality probes (e.g., high detection p-values, SNP overlap, non-CpG probes, cross-hybridizing probes).
5. **Differential methylation analysis**: Statistical testing using the ``limma`` package to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and optionally regions (DMRs).
6. **Visualization and biological interpretation**: Generation of volcano plots, heatmaps, and pathway enrichment results to facilitate interpretation.

This pipeline supports scalable and reproducible analysis, integrating best practices for EPIC array processing in clinical and research contexts.

Advanced Single-Cell Multi-Omics Analysis
==========================================

This section highlights advanced analytical approaches that extend single-cell multi-omics integration to additional molecular layers, including epigenetics, chromatin accessibility, transcription factor (TF) activity, histone modifications, and DNA methylation. These approaches are essential for dissecting complex regulatory mechanisms underlying cell state, lineage commitment, immune dysfunction, and tumor microenvironmental interactions.

Overview of Supported Modalities
--------------------------------

- **scRNA-seq**: Transcriptomic profiling at single-cell resolution
- **CITE-seq**: Surface proteomic quantification using antibody-derived tags (ADTs)
- **scATAC-seq**: Chromatin accessibility profiling for identifying regulatory regions
- **scChIP-seq**: Single-cell histone modification analysis (e.g., H3K27ac, H3K4me3)
- **scCUT&Tag**: Improved epigenomic profiling for TFs and histone marks
- **scBS-seq / snmC-seq**: Single-cell bisulfite sequencing for DNA methylation
- **TCR/BCR-seq**: Immune repertoire analysis of clonal diversity
- **Spatial transcriptomics**: Spatial context to gene expression

1. Multi-Omic Integration Strategies
--------------------------------------

**Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN)**
  - Developed in Seurat v4, allows integration of multiple modalities (e.g., RNA + protein + ATAC)
  - Computes separate nearest neighbor graphs for each modality and merges using optimized weights
  - Supports UMAP, clustering, and differential analysis in joint latent space

**Multimodal Variational Autoencoders (MVAEs)**
  - Deep learning-based frameworks (e.g., totalVI, scVI, MultiVI)
  - Integrate RNA, protein, ATAC, and methylation data using shared latent variables
  - Useful for batch correction, denoising, and imputation

**Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)**
  - Legacy approach in Seurat for RNA–protein or RNA–epigenetic co-embedding
  - Still applicable to datasets with two modalities and large feature overlap

**Multi-Omic Factor Analysis (MOFA+)**
  - Matrix factorization approach that identifies latent factors driving variation across omics layers
  - Integrates diverse omics (RNA, ATAC, methylation, histone, proteomic)

2. Epigenetic Profiling with scATAC-seq and CUT&Tag
---------------------------------------------------

**scATAC-seq**

- Detects open chromatin regions, enhancers, and promoters  
- Identify transcription factor motifs using `chromVAR`, `cisTopic`, or `ArchR`  
- Integrate with scRNA-seq using `Seurat` WNN or `ArchR`'s constrained alignment

**CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation)**

- Profiles histone modifications and transcription factor binding  
- Superior signal-to-noise ratio compared to scChIP-seq  
- Use `Signac`, `epiScanpy`, or custom pipelines for integration

**TF Inference**

- Infer active TFs from scATAC/CUT&Tag using:
  - Motif enrichment (`HOMER`, `chromVAR`)  
  - Footprinting (`TOBIAS`, `PIQ`)  
  - Gene regulatory networks (`SCENIC`, `pySCENIC`)


3. DNA Methylation Integration
------------------------------

**scBS-seq / snmC-seq**

- Provide methylation status at single-CpG resolution  
- Identify hypo/hypermethylated regions in specific cell states  

**Tools**

- `methylKit` (bulk-style aggregation)  
- `epiScanpy` (single-cell dimensionality reduction)  
- `methAtlas` for cell type deconvolution

**Integration with RNA-seq**

- Correlate promoter methylation with gene expression  
- Use `MOFA+` or joint matrix factorization to model inverse relationships

**Cross-modality Visualization**

- Overlay chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and methylation along pseudo-time trajectories


4. Spatial Transcriptomics Overlay
----------------------------------

- Overlay single-cell clusters on spatial maps using:
  - `Seurat::TransferData()` with spatial RNA
  - `Tangram` (deep learning for cell-type mapping to Visium slices)
  - `cell2location` for probabilistic cell deconvolution

- Add ADT, ATAC, or methylation signal intensities to spatial positions
- Identify spatial niches (e.g., immune hotspots, tumor borders, stem-like zones)

5. Cross-Modal Regulatory Inference
-----------------------------------

- **SCENIC+ATAC/CUT&Tag:**
  - Derive TF-gene networks supported by both motif activity and co-expression
  - Visualize regulon specificity scores across tissue regions or cell states

- **Joint Peak-to-Gene Linking (RNA + ATAC):**
  - Link distal accessible chromatin regions to target gene expression
  - Use `ArchR`’s `addPeak2GeneLinks()` or `Cicero` co-accessibility scores

- **Latent Time Inference:**
  - Combine transcriptome + ATAC + methylome to order cells along developmental/activation trajectories
  - Use `Waddington-OT`, `scVelo + ATAC velocity`, or `Palantir`

Example Applications
--------------------

- Mapping epigenetic reprogramming during T cell exhaustion in tumors
- Identifying chromatin features predictive of stemness or metastasis
- Linking enhancer rewiring to immune checkpoint resistance
- Spatially resolving TF networks in inflamed tissue microenvironments
- Deconvolving methylation-dependent transcriptional regulation

Best Practices
--------------

- Apply rigorous QC and batch correction per modality before integration
- Match resolution and depth across omics layers (e.g., 10x 5' + ADT + VDJ + ATAC)
- Leverage visualization overlays to avoid over-interpretation of noisy features

Conclusion
----------

Advanced single-cell multi-omics integration unlocks the potential to understand complex cellular systems through the lens of regulation, phenotype, and spatial context. Combining transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data in a unified framework enables mechanistic dissection of health and disease states with unprecedented resolution.

Refer to individual tool documentation (e.g., MOFA+, ArchR, Seurat, epiScanpy) for implementation details and scaling strategies.

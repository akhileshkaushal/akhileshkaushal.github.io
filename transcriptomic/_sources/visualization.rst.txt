RNA-seq Visualization Module
============================

Purpose
-------

The visualization module generates publication-ready plots to facilitate interpretation of differential gene expression results across experimental groups. It supports multiple visualization formats that highlight both statistical significance and biological relevance.

Plot Types
----------

- **Volcano Plot** â€” Displays differential expression as fold change versus statistical significance.
- **Heatmap** â€” Shows expression patterns of top differentially expressed genes across samples.
- **KEGG Pathview Overlay** â€” Maps log2 fold changes onto KEGG pathway diagrams for biological insight.

Volcano Plot (DESeq2)
---------------------

The pipeline uses `EnhancedVolcano` to create volcano plots that distinguish significantly up- and down-regulated genes.

.. code-block:: r

   EnhancedVolcano(res_df,
     lab = rownames(res_df),
     x = 'log2FoldChange',
     y = 'padj',
     pCutoff = 0.25,
     FCcutoff = 0.3,
     title = 'Volcano: Case_vs_Control',
     legendPosition = 'none'
   )

ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can adjust `pCutoff` and `FCcutoff` for more or less stringent filtering.

Heatmap of Top DEGs
--------------------

The top 50 up- and down-regulated genes (by absolute log2 fold change) are visualized using the `pheatmap` package.

.. code-block:: r

   heatmap_data <- counts_matrix[top_genes, samples]
   pheatmap(heatmap_data, scale = "row", main = "Top DEGs")

- Rows represent genes
- Columns represent samples
- Expression values are z-scaled (row-wise)

KEGG Pathview Overlay
---------------------

Differential expression results can be superimposed on KEGG pathway maps using the `pathview` package. This provides insight into biological processes affected by gene expression changes.

.. code-block:: r

   pathview(
     gene.data = gene_list,
     pathway.id = "hsa04610",
     species = "hsa",
     out.suffix = "Case_vs_Control"
   )

Requirements:
- Internet access (for automatic download of XML pathway definitions), OR
- Pre-cached XML definitions placed in your working directory

Example Output
--------------

Upon successful execution, check your `outputs/` subdirectories for:

- `.tiff` files â€” volcano plots
- `.png` files â€” heatmaps
- `*_pathview_*.png` â€” KEGG overlays for selected pathways

.. code-block:: text

   outputs/
   â””â”€â”€ Case_vs_Control/
       â”œâ”€â”€ Case_vs_Control_volcano_plot.tiff
       â”œâ”€â”€ Case_vs_Control_heatmap.png
       â”œâ”€â”€ Case_vs_Control_pathview_hsa04610.png
       â””â”€â”€ ...

Notes
-----

- Volcano plots and heatmaps are only generated if sufficient DEGs are detected
- Colors and layout can be modified via the corresponding R scripts in `visualization/`
- Pathview plots use a default red-green color scale (log2FC mapped)

Next Steps
----------

Case Study: ITH-aware Somatic Interpretation for WGS/WES
========================================================

**Focus**: Sampling strategy, when to prioritize tumor-normal over tumor-only, ITH-aware filtering and reporting, RNA-based response signatures, and mechanism-informed combinations (c-Jun/JNK/β-catenin axis).

The study established a 399-organoid biobank from 144 PLC patients, quantified ITH, developed multi-gene response signatures, and identified c-Jun-mediated resistance to lenvatinib with a rational combination strategy.

What Was Built
--------------

**Living PLC organoid biobank**

- **Scale**: 399 tumor organoids from 144 patients with primary liver cancer (PLC)
- **Sampling**: Multi-regional sampling from the same tumor and/or metastases
- **Recapitulation**: Models retained patient tumor histology, genomic (mutations, CNAs), and transcriptomic features
- **Utility**: Suitable for drug sensitivity screening and mechanistic work

**Establishment details**

- Overall establishment rate: **75.6%**
- Success linked to:
  - Viable cell proportion at acquisition
  - Time from resection to processing
  - Digestion method

- Culture:
  - Defined media with **Noggin**, **Rspo1**, **Wnt3a**, and growth factors
  - Passaged every 1-3 weeks
  - Recoverable after long-term cryostorage

Cohort Profiling and Heterogeneity
----------------------------------

**Concordance and ITH**

- High tissue-organoid concordance across mutations, CNAs, and expression profiles
- Multi-region sampling revealed substantial inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH)
- Higher mutation/CNA ITH associated with worse overall survival

**Trunk/branch structure**

- **Trunk-dominant tumors**: Majority of driver events early
- **Branch-dominant tumors**: More late-acquired, region-specific alterations
- Implication: Single-region analyses risk missing clinically relevant branch events

Drug Screening and Response Definition
---------------------------------------

**Agents tested**

- Seven clinically relevant drugs:
  - Lenvatinib
  - Sorafenib
  - Regorafenib
  - Apatinib
  - Bevacizumab
  - Pemigatinib
  - Ivosidenib

- Additional agents:
  - Three c-Jun inhibitors
  - PKUF-01 (lenvatinib-veratramine conjugate)

**Response metrics**

- IC50 and normalized AUC per organoid highly correlated (Spearman r > 0.79)
- Patient-level sensitivity: Worst (most resistant) region determines call
- Sensitivity thresholds anchored to clinical ORRs:
  - Lenvatinib: 24.1%
  - Sorafenib: 9.2%
  - Regorafenib: 11%
  - Apatinib: 10.7%
  - Bevacizumab: 3%

**Passage stability**

- Most lines retained stable lenvatinib sensitivity
- A subset gained resistance in later passages, consistent with subclone expansion

**Clinical alignment**

- Sensitivity patterns matched patient outcomes in small sets
- Example: Lenvatinib CR cases were sensitive in all regions; progressors had ≥1 resistant region

Expression Signatures Predicting Response
------------------------------------------

**Lenvatinib signature**

- Training/validation: n=106/106 organoid models
- 254 genes correlated with sensitivity → 13-gene ML signature (e.g., JUN, HIST1H1E, WNT6A)
- AUROC: 0.86 (train), 0.81 (validation)
- TCGA-LIHC clustering with 254-gene set identified ~25% "sensitive" subgroup, matching clinical efficacy

**Other TKIs**

- Sorafenib: AUROC > 0.9
- Regorafenib: AUROC > 0.8
- Apatinib: AUROC > 0.7
- Signatures aligned with patient responses where tested

Mechanism of Lenvatinib Resistance & Combination Strategy
----------------------------------------------------------

**Upstream targets**

- FGFRs highly expressed in PLC organoids
- FGFR knockdown decreased lenvatinib sensitivity

**c-Jun axis**

- Elevated c-Jun correlates with resistance
- Knockdown sensitized resistant models
- Overexpression conferred resistance
- Upstream: Wnt/β-catenin and JNK
  - Knockdown → increased sensitivity
  - Activation → increased resistance

**PKUF-01**

- Designed to co-target FGFR and c-Jun
- Reduced IC50s vs lenvatinib in 20% of resistant organoids
- Xenograft studies confirmed efficacy
- Limitation: Oral absorption in vivo was suboptimal

ITH-aware Somatic Interpretation & Recommendations
---------------------------------------------------

**Why ITH matters**

- Multi-region sampling revealed extensive ITH; ignoring it risks overestimating drug efficacy
- Considering only the most resistant region dropped predicted benefit from 72.9% (organoid-level) to 37.1% (patient-level)

**Sampling strategy**

- Use multi-region tumor sampling whenever possible
- Prioritize tumor-normal over tumor-only for confident somatic calls and contamination estimation
- Include spatially distinct sites (and metastases, if available)
- Map and annotate region-private drivers

**ITH-aware filtering**

- Consolidate calls across regions; categorize as trunk, branch, or region-private mutations
- Apply "worst-region" principle for therapy sensitivity calls

**RNA-based response signatures**

- Incorporate pre-treatment RNA-seq from the same regions used for DNA sequencing
- Compute per-region signature scores for TKIs; default to most resistant score when discordant
- Use as enrichment tools, not definitive diagnostics

**Mechanism-aware reporting**

- Identify resistance-linked pathways such as c-Jun/JNK/β-catenin
- Flag candidates for mechanism-informed combinations (e.g., lenvatinib + c-Jun or JNK inhibitors, PKUF-01)
- Include relevant clinical trial IDs when possible

**Implementation tips**

- Use matched normals where possible for cleaner somatic calls
- Maintain PoN and germline resource VCFs for tumor-only contexts
- Log all tool versions and container IDs for reproducibility

Limitations
-----------

- Small clinical validation set — signatures are research-grade
- Passage-dependent drift in a minority of lines
- PKUF-01 oral formulation limits in vivo

Whole-Exome Sequencing in Relapsing CLL
=======================================

This documentation covers the bioinformatics workflow, modernized pipeline recommendations, and key genomic findings from **Ljungstr√∂m et al., Blood (2016)**, focusing on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in pre-treatment and relapse settings.

The case study provides:
- Scientific context and study hypothesis
- Original bioinformatics methodology
- Modernized WES pipeline recommendations
- Key genomic findings and interpretation guidelines
- Diagrammatic overview of historical vs modern workflows

.. note::
   While the original study used a legacy pipeline (BWA-MEM to hg19, GATK3, VarScan2 with 10% VAF cutoff), this documentation updates all methods to current best practices (BWA-MEM2, GRCh38, GATK4 Mutect2, lower VAF thresholds).

Whole-Exome Sequencing in Relapsing CLL
=======================================

This documentation summarizes the bioinformatics workflow, updated WGS/WES pipeline recommendations, and key findings from Yang et al. (2024) on pharmacogenomic profiling of intra-tumor heterogeneity in liver cancer. It includes study context, major results, and interpretation guidelines.

.. note::
   The original study by Yang *et al.* (2024) focused primarily on experimental pharmacogenomic profiling using multi-region organoid models, with sequencing and analysis tailored to that context.  
   In this documentation, the workflow has been adapted and modernized for general-purpose WGS/WES bioinformatics â€” replacing the original methods with current best practices such as BWA-MEM2 alignment to GRCh38, GATK4 Mutect2 for somatic calling, and lower VAF thresholds to enhance sensitivity and reproducibility.
